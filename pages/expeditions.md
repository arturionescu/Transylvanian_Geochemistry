# Field Work and Expeditions

Within the groups activities we will visit a number of exciting environments with diverse geological and geochemical characteristics. The aim is to collect data from diverse geodynamic and -tectonic settings. Different geodynamic settings provide us with different fluid (water and gas) genesis. Our sampling approach collects samples across large spatial scales or high-resolution sampling, to better understand teh different systems. These field works typically have a team of of scientists with simialr backgrounds, sometimes the field team is joined by other reserchers with diverse backgrounds and expertise.
