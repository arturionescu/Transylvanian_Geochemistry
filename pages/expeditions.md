# Field Work and Expeditions

Within the groups activities we will visit a number of exciting environments with diverse geological and geochemical characteristics. The aim is to collect data from diverse geodynamic and -tectonic settings. Different geodynamic settings provide us with different fluid (water and gas) genesis. Our sampling approach collects samples across large spatial scales or high-resolution sampling, to better understand teh different systems. These field works typically have a team of of scientists with similar backgrounds, sometimes the field team is joined by other researchers with diverse backgrounds and expertise.

## Discovering the Carpathian Volcanism - September 2018

In September 2018, 7 researchers, from 4 different countries set of from Cluj-Napoca (Romania) for a 10 day sampling expedition across the Easter-Carpathians Neogenic Volcanic belt. The sampling expedition entitled “Discovering the Carpathian Volcanism” is tried to answer key questions regarding carbon degassing and origin of fluids of the volcanic belt. The Eastern-Carpathians where selected because the volcanic centers show a high diversity of ages, spanning from millions to tens of thousands of years. The Carpathian volcanism having long time of inactivity, up to millions of years. Although in the region there are no more “active volcanism”, the region is considered being one of the highest CO2 degassing regions in Europe. It is the first detailed geochemical investigation of the geochemistry of fluids at regional scale in this sector of Europe that is characterized by volcanism and active tectonic.

The team visited 50 sites over 10 days, from the southernmost part of the volcanic range up to the northernmost one. In order to see how the volcanic gases interact with the other geological units (sedimentary basin to the west, flysch and metamorphic carbonates to the east), it have been selected some sampling points that fall in correspondence of the interaction between the volcanic systems and sedimentary and metamorphic complexes. The field team used different sampling protocols, for the different fluids, but also adapting their methods and procedures in order to solve some problems and collect fluids that are well representative and less contaminated by air. 

The field team included Principal Investigator Artur Ionescu (Babes-Bolyai University, Romania; MTA-ELTE Volcanology Research Group, Hungary), Kyriaki Daskalopoulou (University of Palermo; National and Kapodistrian University of Athens), Sergio Calabrese (University of Palermo, Italy), Boglarka-Mercedesz Kis (MTA-ELTE Volcanology Research Group, Hungary; Babes-Bolyai University, Romania), Cristian Pop (Babes-Bolyai University, Romania) and Calin Baciu (Babes-Bolyai University, Romania). Antonio Caracausi (INGV Palermo), one of the principal investigators and promoters of the idea.
