# Field Work and Expeditions

Within the groups activities we will visit a number of exciting environments with diverse geological and geochemical characteristics. The aim is to collect data from diverse geodynamic and -tectonic settings. Different geodynamic settings provide us with different fluid (water and gas) genesis. Our sampling approach collects samples across large spatial scales or high-resolution sampling, to better understand teh different systems. These field works typically have a team of of scientists with similar backgrounds, sometimes the field team is joined by other researchers with diverse backgrounds and expertise.

## Discovering the Carpathian Volcanism - September 2018 (RO)

In September 2018, 7 researchers, from 4 different countries set of from Cluj-Napoca (Romania) for a 10 day sampling expedition across the Easter-Carpathians Neogenic Volcanic belt. The sampling expedition entitled “Discovering the Carpathian Volcanism” is tried to answer key questions regarding carbon degassing and origin of fluids of the volcanic belt. The Eastern-Carpathians where selected because the volcanic centers show a high diversity of ages, spanning from millions to tens of thousands of years. The Carpathian volcanism having long time of inactivity, up to millions of years. Although in the region there are no more “active volcanism”, the region is considered being one of the highest CO2 degassing regions in Europe. It is the first detailed geochemical investigation of the geochemistry of fluids at regional scale in this sector of Europe that is characterized by volcanism and active tectonic.

The team visited 50 sites over 10 days, from the southernmost part of the volcanic range up to the northernmost one. In order to see how the volcanic gases interact with the other geological units (sedimentary basin to the west, flysch and metamorphic carbonates to the east), it have been selected some sampling points that fall in correspondence of the interaction between the volcanic systems and sedimentary and metamorphic complexes. The field team used different sampling protocols, for the different fluids, but also adapting their methods and procedures in order to solve some problems and collect fluids that are well representative and less contaminated by air. 

The field team included Principal Investigator Artur Ionescu (Babes-Bolyai University, Romania; MTA-ELTE Volcanology Research Group, Hungary), Kyriaki Daskalopoulou (University of Palermo; National and Kapodistrian University of Athens), Sergio Calabrese (University of Palermo, Italy), Boglarka-Mercedesz Kis (MTA-ELTE Volcanology Research Group, Hungary; Babes-Bolyai University, Romania), Cristian Pop (Babes-Bolyai University, Romania) and Calin Baciu (Babes-Bolyai University, Romania). Antonio Caracausi (INGV Palermo), one of the principal investigators and promoters of the idea.

## Thermal Karst of Herculane - March 2019 (RO)

In the Cerna Valley basin, located southwest of the Southern Carpathians, an aquifer complex has developed. The basin is strongly influenced by hydrogeothermal phenomena, acting within two major geological structures, the Cerna Syncline and the Cerna Graben. The complex consists mainly of Jurassic and Cretaceous carbonate rocks, as well as the upper part of the Cerna Granite that is highly fractured, tectonically sunken into the graben. The geothermal investigations have shown the existence of some areas with values of the geothermal gradient falling into the 110-200ºC/km interval, and temperatures of 13.8-16ºC at the depth of 30 m. The zone with the maximal flux intensity is situated between the Baile Herculane railway station and the Crucea Ghizelei Well, an area where 24 sources (10 wells and 14 springs) are known. The geothermal anomaly is also extended to the south (Toplet), north (Mehadia) and NE (Piatra Puşcată), a fact, which is stressed by the existence of hypothermal springs with low mineralization. At the entire thermo-mineral reservoir scale, the temperature of the water sources, the total mineralization, and the H2S and CH4 quantity are increasing from the north to the south, and the pH and natural radioactivity are following the same trend. 

A small group journeyed to the thermal karst system of Baile Herculane (Romania). Our aim was to investigate this amazing geochemical system from a complex point of view: from the gases, to the water, to the minerals and up to the microbes. The team was made up from: the University of Perugia (Artur Ionescu), Babes-Bolyai University (Calin Baciu, Cristain Pop and Alin-Marius Nicula), INGV Palermo / University of Palermo (Daskalopoulou Kyriaki), ATOMKI Debrecen (Marjan Temovski and Kata Molnar) and by the Institute of Speleology Emil Racovita (Traian Brad and Aurel Persoiu).

## Thermal Karst of Herculane - March 2019 (RO)

The project entitled "Improving the estimation of tectonic carbon flux" funded by the Deep Carbon Observatory had its first field work in the Balkans, more exactly in Slovenia. With the help of the Geological Survey of Slovenia (Geoloski zavod Slovenije) the joint team visited a total of 50 sites all over the country, spanning from thermal drilling's, to mineral water wells to karst springs. Samples were collected for a multitude of parameters in order to investigate almost the full fluid geochemistry of the area. 

My biggest gratitude is for the Geological Survey of Slovenia for helping in the site selections, logistics and field support  during these days. The team included: University of Perugia (Artur Ionescu and Carlo Cardellini), Babes-Bolyai University (Cristian Pop) and teh Geological survey of Slovenia (Nina Rman, Miroslav Medic, Katja Koren, Luka Seriaz, Zmago Bole, Tomislav Matoz and Sonja Cerar).
