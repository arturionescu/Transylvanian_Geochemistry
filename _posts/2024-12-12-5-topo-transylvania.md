The Institute of Earth Physics and Space Science (EPSS) TOPO-Transylvania team joined forces with the Transylvanian Geochemistry Research Group in Covasna. The of EPSS was to install reflectors on the massive approx. 2 m3 concrete foundations built in the summer to monitor surface movements in the seismic area of Covasna, which is close to the major Romanian seismic zone of Vrancea. In addition, the EPSS team conducted regular CO2 and radon measurements in the vicinity of the Integrated Geodynamic Station, unique in Romania. The current visit of the EPSS team gave the opportunity to lay the foundations for a longer-term collaboration with the research team, with whom we will collaborate in the geochemical investigation of CO2-rich surface gas outflows in Covasna. We spent a very intensive day in the field and in discussions.
