The Earth's subsurface is home to some of the most mysterious and least explored ecosystems. Tucked within the crust, in the myriad cracks and pockets of rock, diverse microbial communities flourish. Microbes harness energy sources that are entirely beyond human reach, thriving in environments radically different from our own surface conditions.
In recent years, there has been increasing exploration of this vast and largely unknown ecosystem, yet it continues to pose significant challenges for study. The complexity and inaccessibility of subsurface environments make them some of the most difficult areas on Earth to investigate thoroughly.
To unravel the secrets this deep ecosystem holds, we rely on a unique conduit of information: fluids. These fluids traverse the rocks deep beneath the Earth's surface, interacting with the surrounding rocks and microbial communities. As they journey through this hidden ecosystem, they collect and carry vital information about their environment. Eventually, these fluids reach the surface, sometimes kilometres from their origin, bringing with them invaluable insights about the subsurface world and its intricate processes. These fluids provide a rare glimpse into the depths, offering precious information about the otherwise inaccessible secrets of the deep Earth.
This is what we seek: specific locations on Earth where unique conditions permit deep fluids to rise to the surface. As these fluids emerge into the sunlight, we quickly capture them, securing the valuable information they carry before they can interact with the surface environment, looking for information to deepen our understanding of Earth's hidden biomes, and that could reshape our understanding of life and its resilience in the most extreme conditions.![Alt text](/assets/img/uploads/2024-09-20.jpg "Deborah Bastoni collecting water samples at a hot spring")
