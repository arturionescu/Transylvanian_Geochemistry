The HUN-REN Geophysical and Space Research Institute has organized the international TOPO-Europe workshop in Sopron again this year between 14-17 October 2024.

One of the main objectives of TOPO-Europe is to provide an interdisciplinary forum for the exchange of knowledge and information on the youngest tectonic processes in Europe. Another important goal is to promote and encourage multidisciplinary research on a European scale, increase researcher mobility and contribute to the training of future researchers. The initiative creates an opportunity for participants to actively engage in European geodynamic and geophysical research in the “natural laboratories” targeted by TOPO-EUROPE. The collaborations based on the workshop discussions significantly contribute to the joint goals of in the fields of renewable energy, climate change and geological hazards research. The mmeeting was split into a field excursion, plenary sessions and individual break-out group discussions.

This followed a sub-meeting of the TOPO-Transylvania where the recent advances were presented and ideas were discussed how to further develop the research in this area.
