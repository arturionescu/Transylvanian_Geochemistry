The members of the group first met during the Vulcano Summer School on in-situ measurements and sampling of volcanic gases (Sicily, IT) in June 2024. For the majority of the group this was the first encounter with an active volcano, and thus they became fascinated. One month later, in July, the members attended the 2nd Carpathian Fluid Geochemistry Summer School, in the Eastern Carpathians (RO). This is where the idea came up to start working together on geochemistry... 

Thus the Transylvanian Geochemistry Research Group was formed with seven members!

Today the group consists of 11 members working on different aspects of geochemistry starting from origin of fluids, effects of diffuse degassing on soil, development of low-cost multigas, carbon fluxes in populated areas, combining geochemical proxys with seismic event, effects and co-habitability of plants in high CO2-rich areas and development of user-frindly GIS tools for geochimst.
