Finding yourself in a room full of experts and leaders in a given field can be an intimidating experience. However, the friendly and open environment fostered by the TOPO-Europe and TOPO-Transylvania meeting transforms this into an enriching and memorable event for all participants. Upon arrival, we were welcomed with icebreaker activities that facilitated introductions and laid the foundation for meaningful connections and collaborations.

The first day commenced with a field trip to various geological sites in the Sopron area, which gave an overview of the geological evolution of the NW Pannonian Basin, focusing on the Alpine-Pannonian transition zone. The trip explored the region's tectonic history, including nappe stacking, extensional collapse, and basin formation processes from the Miocene to the present. Stopped at key sites showcasing key geological formations, such as metamorphic basement rocks, syn-rift and post-rift sediments, and deformation structures. It also included insights into regional uplift, inversion processes, and geodynamic evolution. The multidisciplinary nature of the conference was particularly evident in the diverse approaches each participant took in analyzing these sites, creating an ideal setting for knowledge exchange and the sharing of techniques.

The first session covered interactions between deep Earth and surface processes, tectonic-driven deformation, and volatile degassing in the Pannonian Basin, continuing with talks on magmatic activity, long-term climate predictions, and international scientific collaborations. The second session, address geothermal energy, seismic imaging, carbon capture, and the role of fluids in seismic activity. During this these in-depth presentations, allowed each participant to showcase their expertise and research. While some topics were more accessible than others, all were captivating, offering valuable insights into the thought processes and methodologies behind the presented work.

The last day was dedicated to working group discussions on tectonics, climate, biogeodynamics, and renewable geoenergy, culminating in synthesis for research proposals, plenary reports, and a general discussion before the meetingâ€™s official closure with a networking session. Social activities were an integral part of the conference. Some involved cultural experiences, enabling participants from across Europe to immerse themselves in Hungarian cuisine and traditions, while others took the form of brainstorming sessions. These discussions focused on ongoing projects initiated within TOPO-Europe and TOPO-Transylvania, with all contributions valued. These collaborative efforts paved the way for new partnerships and future research opportunities.
