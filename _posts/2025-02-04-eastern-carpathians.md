It is well known that the Romanian Carpathian range is the biggest geogenic carbon source in Eastern Europe, having hundreds of gas-rich springs and gas manifestations like mofettas or diffuse degassing areas. In the Eastern Carpathians especially the volcanic and the metamorphic range emit high amount of CO2-rich fluids. We started our investigation in December 2022, and we finished in November last year in January. The main aim of the survey was to investigate different locations through an N-S transect of the E-Carpathians in order to create a systematic database, to quantify and fingerprint the emanated fluids and to create a conceptual geochemical model of the region. During the campains we sampled gas samples, and depending on the intensity of the free gas quantity we sampled in Giggenbach-bottles with soda solution, double-valve sampler or small exeteiner tubes. This work is a collaborative initiative UBB Cluj, Universita di Perugia, ATOMKI Debrecen, Institutul de Speleologie Emil Racovita Cluj and Universita di Firenze.
